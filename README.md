# soloprojCD2
This project is loosely inspired by reddit. Reddit is a social media app that caters to almost anyone's interest. The goal of my project was to strongly implinent bootstrap 4 and 
improve on my UI skills. The page is built off 3 core web pages. A registration/login page, a wall which displays user interactivity and a edit and upload for users content. 
Overall, I was able to achieve most of what I was set out to build. A few minor tweaks could have been done here and there. One thing I really would have liked to incorporate is some
dynamic rendering.
